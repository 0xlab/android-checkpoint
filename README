DMTCP/Android
-------------

Snapshot date: Nov 5, 2012
By: 0xlab - http://0xlab.org/

The development snapshot has been tested on Cyanogenmod/ICS and AOSP/ICS.

Quick Note:
 - Apply the patch to the correspoding folder, for example the bionic/*.patch
   apply to the android/bionic.

 - You should put all file in dmtcp-utils into /system/bin/ and chmod to 700.
   * zygote_dmtcp.sh : For starting zygote with DMTCP.
   * dmtcp-fix : Fix premission for android system files.
   * dmtcp-close : Script for close zygote with DMTCP, if you just `stop zygote`
                   zygote with dmtcp may become zombie.
   * dmtcp-clear : Clear checkpoint image file and DMTCP debug info.

 - The init.rc script appends serval zygote variants
   * zygote_ori :
     Starting zygote without DMTCP.
   * zygote :
     Script for starting zygote with DMTCP, restart zygote if the image file
     exist, otherwise will start with DMTCP and build a checkpoint image.

 - zygote will freeze when booting into Launcher upon executing start/restart
   with DMTCP.  You could be aware of the following messages by logcat:
    "Input event dispatching timed out sending to com.xxx.xxx"

 - DMTCP may cause restart failure if the `new` dynamic linker overlaps with the
   `old` (checkpoint image) address space because the new dynamic linker in
   ICS's bionic libc is no longer loaded into fix address.

 - First boot time you should start zygote_ori instead of zygote to finish the
   apk opt process.

 - Some core file may have wrong access premission after restart dmtcp, you can
   fix it by run the dmtcp-fix.
